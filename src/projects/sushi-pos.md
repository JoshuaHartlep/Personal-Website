# Sushi POS System

This comprehensive point-of-sale system was designed specifically for sushi restaurants to streamline operations and enhance customer experience. The application features a modern, intuitive interface built with React and TypeScript, providing real-time order management, comprehensive inventory tracking, and detailed customer analytics.

## Key Features

The system includes advanced features like table management, split billing, custom order modifications, and integration with payment processors. The backend utilizes REST APIs connected to a SQL database for reliable data persistence and quick retrieval. Special attention was paid to the user experience, ensuring that restaurant staff can efficiently process orders even during peak hours.

## Technical Challenges

One of the key challenges was designing a flexible menu system that could accommodate the complex nature of sushi orders, including different fish types, preparation styles, and dietary restrictions. The solution includes a dynamic pricing engine and real-time inventory updates to prevent overselling of limited ingredients.

## What I Learned

- Complex state management in React for real-time updates
- Database design for restaurant operations
- User experience design for high-pressure environments
- Integration with third-party payment systems
