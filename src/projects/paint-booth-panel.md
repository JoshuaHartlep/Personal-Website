# Full Stack Paint Booth Electrical

This industrial automation project involved designing, wiring, programming, and deploying a complete control system for an automated paint booth at Worthington Enterprises.

## Hardware Implementation

I was responsible for building the control panel, including hardware installation of emergency stops, bypass selectors, and operator buttons. I coordinated with contractors to route and land field wiring, and personally installed and tested the panel on-site to ensure proper integration with the booth hardware.

## Control System Programming

The control system logic was developed using ladder logic in RSLogix 5000, and I implemented all machine states, safety interlocks, and fault handling routines. I also programmed an HMI using FactoryTalk View (with supporting Python and HTML-based scripts where needed) to allow operators to view system status, engage bypass modes, and interact with real-time process controls.

## Real-World Impact

This project gave me direct experience in industrial control design, safety compliance, and cross-functional collaboration in a real manufacturing environment. It significantly deepened my understanding of how automation, electrical design, and process safety come together in the real world.

## What I Learned

- Industrial automation and control systems
- Safety-critical system design
- Cross-functional team collaboration
- On-site installation and commissioning
- Real-time process control interfaces
