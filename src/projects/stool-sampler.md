# Engineering Design in the Real World: Our Stool Sampling Project with Duke Hospital

This was one of the first projects where I really got to apply the full scope of the engineering design process to a real-world challenge—and it happened to involve something most people probably don’t think about too often: stool samples.

In Fall 2024, I led a team of four undergraduates at Duke to design a more efficient stool sampling kit for a research lab at Duke Hospital. Our client was a principal investigator at the hospital who told us that one of their biggest bottlenecks was simply not getting enough usable samples. Either participants were unwilling to provide them, or the samples that *did* come in weren’t usable without excessive time and labor from the researchers.

## Starting with the Problem

The first few weeks were all about **client interviews** and scoping. We wanted to understand exactly where the pain points were and what counted as a “successful” sample. It turns out both ends of the process—collection by the participant and processing by the researchers—had issues.

We worked to define our **design criteria**, which focused on three big things:
- **Minimize participant involvement**
- **Minimize researcher handling**
- **Ensure compatibility with centrifuge tubes**

From there, we went wide with brainstorming, creating and comparing ideas against a weighted decision matrix. It felt like every solution we came up with either required too much from the participant (which could reduce compliance) or made life harder for the researchers.

## Iterating Through Failure

We created and tested multiple early prototypes—some too bulky, some too messy, some just didn’t work. I learned quickly that iteration isn’t just a buzzword in design—it’s survival. Every failed design taught us something new about user behavior, usability, and constraints.

Eventually, I came up with a two-part mechanism that checked all our boxes: the sample was collected directly into a centrifuge-safe tube with no messy transfer step and little effort required from the participant. It streamlined the entire workflow.

## From CAD to Real World

Once we had a concept that worked on paper, I took charge of the 3D modeling and prototyping. Using CAD software, I designed and refined our high-fidelity prototype over several iterations. We tested using oatmeal (our stand-in for stool), and it filled the tube cleanly—exactly as planned.

I created multiple 2D technical drawings and finalized our 3D model for presentation.

## Lessons That Stuck

When we finally presented our design to the client and a panel of Duke faculty, they were impressed with how clean and practical the final system was. But what stuck with me most wasn’t just the technical accomplishment—it was everything around it.

I learned how critical communication is in engineering, how to explain complex ideas to people outside your major, and how to take feedback without losing momentum. Working with a team under real-world constraints, with an actual client and high stakes, taught me more than any classroom ever could.

I’m proud of what we built, but I’m even more excited by what it taught me about being an engineer.
