# Halfway through: What I've Learned as an Electrical/Software Engineering Intern

A month into my electrical/controls software internship at Worthington Enterprises, and honestly, I'm starting to understand why people say internships are where you actually learn how engineering works in the real world. The technical skills are only half the story, the other half is figuring out how to navigate professional dynamics, manage projects, and communicate ideas effectively.

## The Safety Training Reality Check

Let me be real: the first week or two of just straight safety training was not exactly thrilling. But working in a high-throughput manufacturing environment where actual heavy machinery is running 24/7, I get why this stuff is non-negotiable. When you're designing control systems that could potentially hurt someone if they malfunction, that boring safety training suddenly becomes very relevant.

## Technical Skills That Actually Matter

The technical learning curve has been steep but incredibly rewarding. What's been surprising is how much this work is essentially **full-stack development for industrial systems**. I'm writing ladder logic in RSLogix 5000 (which is basically visual programming), but I'm also building HMI interfaces using **HTML and Python** for the user-facing controls. The HMI design work feels remarkably similar to web development, because it's creating intuitive interfaces, handling user inputs, and managing state.

For my paint booth automation project, I designed and programmed a complete control panel from scratch. This involved writing the backend logic for conveyor movement and spray actuation, then building the frontend interface that operators actually interact with. It's like building a web app, except instead of handling HTTP requests, you're controlling servo motors and safety interlocks.

My main project for this internship involves redesigning safety systems for one of our newer machines; replacing poor-performing components with modern Keyence lockable switches and programmable safety controllers. The debugging process when something goes wrong with a PLC program is basically identical to debugging any other software system.

## The Professional Skills Nobody Tells You About

What's been eye-opening is watching how much of engineering is actually **project management and communication**. My mentor engineer is constantly juggling multiple projects, and he spends as much time in meetings as he does actually engineering. The interpersonal skills are just as critical as the technical ones.

When I was given ownership of my safety system redesign project, I had to go through the entire lifecycle, from initial concept to creating a proposal, budgeting, getting contractor quotes, and then presenting to a panel of my bosses. That presentation was honestly more nerve-wracking than any exam I've taken at Duke. I had to clearly convey not just the technical details, but why this investment would have an enormous payout in less than a year.

## Time Management in the Real World

One thing that's hit me hard is how different time management is when you're not being supervised constantly. My mentor somehow manages like eight major projects at once, each at different stages and with different stakeholders. Watching him context-switch between a budget meeting and a technical debugging session has made me realize that **mental agility** might be one of the most important professional skills.

## What I'm Taking Away

This internship is teaching me that engineering is fundamentally about **solving real problems with real constraints**. The combination of technical depth and professional skills feels like exactly what I need to be building right now. Whether I end up in traditional software engineering or stay in industrial automation, the problem-solving approach and project management experience will transfer directly.

Plus, there's something pretty satisfying about writing code that controls actual physical machines. When my ladder logic runs correctly, conveyors move and paint gets sprayed. That's immediate feedback you don't get in most software jobs.

I'm only halfway through the internship, but I'm already seeing how this experience is changing how I think about my career. The blend of software skills, hardware integration, and project ownership feels like exactly the kind of challenging, multidisciplinary work I want to be doing.

Now back to debugging why my safety controller keeps throwing fault codes...
