I just got back from Duke's cultural immersion program in China, and honestly, I'm still processing everything. When I signed up for this all-expenses-paid trip through Duke Kunshan University, I thought it would be a cool way to see the Great Wall and maybe pick up some cultural knowledge. What I didn't expect was for it to completely rewire how I think about community, urban design, and what "normal" life actually looks like.

## DKU Really Had Their Stuff Together

First off, major props to Duke Kunshan University for coordinating this for 90+ students. They handled everything—flights, accommodations, meals, transportation, cultural activities—and somehow made it feel seamless rather than like herding cats. We hit Kunshan, Nanjing, and Beijing, plus I tacked on a trip to Shenzhen afterward to visit a friend (DKU covered my flight up to a week after, which was clutch).

The logistics alone were impressive, but what really stood out was how thoughtfully they structured everything. This wasn't just a tourist trip with some educational buzzwords slapped on top.

## Night Markets and Family Meals Hit Different

Some of my favorite moments were the **night markets in Nanjing and Beijing**. These places were absolutely electric—live music, food vendors everywhere, and this communal energy that you just don't get in most American spaces. People were hanging out, eating, talking, and it felt like the entire neighborhood was one big living room.

The **family-style meals** we had every day were another game-changer. In the U.S., we're so used to ordering individual plates and eating in our own little bubbles. But sharing dishes creates this natural conversation and connection that made even meals with random classmates feel meaningful. 

I truly can't believe this was all free. From the busses to the tour guides to the food, it was just absolutely amazing. One of my favorite places was the famous Quanjude Roast Duck, where we all got to feast on Peking Duck together in Beijing (chef's kiss).

And can we talk about how ridiculously affordable everything was? We would regularly get hot pot or Korean BBQ for $10-15 USD and be absolutely stuffed. I even got a perm for $20 (which would easily cost $200+ back home). Street food meals were usually under $6 and somehow more filling than anything I'd get for triple that price in Durham. The value was honestly mind-blowing.

## The Stuff That Actually Made Me Think

Beyond the obvious cultural experiences (yes, we saw the Great Wall and Forbidden City—both incredible), I started noticing patterns that challenged a lot of my assumptions:

**Collectivist values aren't just an abstract concept.** You see it in how people navigate public spaces, how families interact, how decisions get made. Even simple things like how people queue up or share space felt different from the individualistic approach I'm used to.

**Urban design actually shapes community.** Chinese cities are built for people to bump into each other—dense, walkable, with public spaces that encourage spontaneous interaction. Compare that to most American cities where you drive from your house to a parking lot and back, barely seeing your neighbors.

**Labor inequality is real and uncomfortable.** The cheap taxis, street food, and services that made everything convenient came at the cost of extremely low wages for workers. It forced me to think about the hidden costs of the "affordable" lifestyle that tourists (including me) were benefiting from.

## The Reality Check Moments

Not everything was Instagram-worthy. In local Beijing neighborhoods, I saw cramped housing, shared quarters, and public toilets that reminded me how much material comfort I take for granted in America. It wasn't poverty tourism—it was just reality for a lot of people. And that contrast made me think differently about what I consider "normal."

## The Propaganda Question (Spoiler: It Wasn't What I Expected)

Before going, people kept warning me about photographers and "Chinese propaganda" and how it would be like paparazzi following us around. That... didn't happen at all. Our program had one photographer and one videographer for the entire trip, and they were super non-intrusive. Honestly, I'm glad they were there—having professional-grade photos of the trip that I can easily access is pretty sweet.

## Why Any Duke Student Should Do This

Here's the thing: you don't need a Chinese background or any particular interest in Asia to get value from this program. I went in with pretty basic knowledge, and that was fine. The insights I gained weren't just about China—they were about how culture shapes everything from urban planning to social interaction to economic systems.

This experience changed how I think about:
- What community actually looks like when cities are designed for it
- How collectivist vs. individualist values play out in daily life
- The real costs behind "cheap" services and convenience
- My own assumptions about what constitutes a "good" standard of living

## The Shenzhen Bonus Round

The post-program trip to Shenzhen was worth it just for the additional context. Seeing a ultra-modern tech hub after experiencing Beijing's mix of ancient and contemporary gave me an even better sense of how diverse "modern Chinese urban life" actually is.

## Bottom Line

When people ask me how China was, I tell them it was one of the most thought-provoking experiences I've had. Not because everything was perfect or because I'm now obsessed with Chinese culture, but because it forced me to examine assumptions I didn't even know I had.

If you're a Duke student and this program is available, just do it. Even if you think you're not interested, even if you don't have any background knowledge, even if you're worried about being out of your comfort zone. That discomfort is exactly the point, and it's worth it.

This wasn't just a trip. It was a perspective shift that I'm still unpacking months later. Did I mention it was all free??
