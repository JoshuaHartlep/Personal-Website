# North Carolina Powerlifting State Championships 2026: What Months of Prep Just to Bomb Out Taught Me

### 📱 [Watch the TikTok Summary](https://www.tiktok.com/@joshhartlep/video/7604598411467312415)

On January 31st, 2026, I competed at the North Carolina State Championship powerlifting meet just outside of Charlotte. It was my first meet in two years. I had circled that date on my calendar for months.

Technically, I prepared specifically for about eight weeks. Realistically, the journey started way before that.

Before I even began prep, I cut from the 90 kg (198 lb) weight class down to 82.5 kg (182 lb). I wanted to see if I could lean out, stay disciplined, and maintain most of my strength. In my head, it was going to be the best of both worlds.

It was not.

I wasn't on a good program, and although I pushed myself hard every day and stayed displined to the best of my ability, I lost more strength than I expected. Not the end of the world, but definitely noticeable. In hindsight, I think I might have cut the weight too fast. And that forced me to adjust.

## Building My Own Prep

I do not have a powerlifting coach. We're all trying to save costs as best we can, and coaches are a pretty penny. Additionally, I wanted to take ownership of the process. So I used ChatGPT as a consultant, read through programming principles, studied RPE-based training, and built my own eight-week program centered entirely around squat, bench, and deadlift.

Some days I trained with friends at Duke. Most days it was just me, headphones on, spreadsheet open, following percentages I wrote myself.

It was strangely isolating, but also empowering. Every lift was intentional. Every week had a purpose.

One of the biggest lessons during prep was that **training smarter beats training harder**.

For years, I equated progress with suffering. If I was not crawling out from under the bar, I did not feel like I was doing enough. But as I researched, I let myself accept what I always _knew_ but didn't want to admit. I stayed in the RPE 6 to 8 range. Leaving one or two reps in the tank. Walking away feeling strong instead of destroyed.

That was hard for me.

But it works.

And it applies to everything. Coursework. Personal projects. Even internships and applications. Going all out every single day sounds noble, but it is rarely optimal. It's hard to really internalize until you go through it yourself, but it really is true: sustainable progress wins.

## The Invisible Work

Another thing prep forced me to confront was how much the other 23 hours of the day matter.

Sleep. Hydration. Stress. Food quality. Body weight fluctuations. Even mindset.

You cannot out-train bad recovery.

Some weeks, I felt strong. Other weeks, I felt stuck under the same weights. Progress was not linear at all. And honestly, it still is not. Unforunately, it hasn't been for years and sometimes I get really frusturated from it. But I trust the process more now. Strength builds quietly before it shows up loudly. I learned this in my academic life too. I literally applied to hundreds of internships this fall, spending hours a day on it just to not even get interviews from 99% of the companies. I thought I would never get an offer, just like sometimes I think I'll never hit my lifting goals. But eventually my work all paid off, and now I can't wait to go to Asana in NYC this summer and learn so so much.

# Meet Weekend

We drove down the day before. Three students from Duke came with me, two of which I hadn't met before. Being in a new environment, cutting weight, thinking about attempts, meeting new people, it is a lot mentally.

The morning of the meet, I was extremely nervous. Watching my new friends compete and kill it in the earlier session made it worse. I kept thinking about how strong I used to be at 198. Numbers that used to move fast now felt heavier at 182.

That comparison was unnecessary.

I should have focused on the present version of myself, but it was just too hard to do.

## Squat

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 1.5rem; align-items: flex-start; margin: 1rem 0;">
  <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 250px;">
    <p>My opener was 175 kg (385 lbs). It moved smoothly. Three white lights. That always feels good.</p>
    <p>Second attempt was 182.5 kg (402 lbs). That one required focus, but it was controlled. Locked it out clean. That being said, I knew that was about all that I had in me.</p>
    <p>For my third, I called for 185 kg (408 lbs). I wanted to push it. As I unracked it, I could tell it was I didn't have it, and I was okay with that. I fought it out of the hole, but I stalled and had to dump it.</p>
    <p>No regrets there. It was an honest miss. I walked off feeling steady and happy I didn't fight too long, and instead saved my energy.</p>

## Bench Press: The Reality Check

Bench is where everything fell apart.

For the last couple of years, my butt has consistently come off the bench when I press heavy. In USAPL, that is not allowed. Glutes must stay down. Heels must stay flat.

I always told myself I would fix it before meet day.

I never fully did.

In powerlifting, your first attempt (opener) should be extremely easy. I set my opener at 110 kg (242.5 lbs). That was ego. At 198, 240 felt easy. I convinced myself I should still be able to hit it easy.

During warmups, I felt slow. After some deliberation, I finally came down to earth and tried to lower my opener to 235 at the table. Unfortunately, the guy told me it was too late. Once the round is about to start, you are locked in.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 1.5rem; align-items: flex-start; margin: 1rem 0;">
  <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 250px;">
    <p>First attempt: 110 kg.<br>Two red lights. One white. I got it up, but my heels were not fully flat.</p>
    <p>Second attempt: 110 again.<br>Missed it. After they made me rerack due to form, I just couldn't press it up.</p>
    <p>Now I was in a position you should never be in at a meet. Third attempt. Same weight. Everything on the line. I tried my best to lock in, knowing I <em>had</em> to hit this.</p>
    <p>I took it down. Pressed. It was a grind if I've ever had one. Probably a ten-second rep. I locked it out and thought I saved it. But no.</p>
    <p>Two red lights. One white.<br>Butt came off the bench.</p>
    <p><strong>I bombed out. 0 for 3.</strong></p>
  </div>
  <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 250px; max-width: 400px;">

  </div>
</div>

That meant I was disqualified from the total.

After Cory consoled me and told me to shake it off, I walked to the bathroom and cried in a stall for maybe five to ten minutes. I was embarrassed and defeated. When I checked the scoreboard later and realized I was the only person in the entire meet to bomb out, it stung even more.

But it was not bad luck. It was my fault, a consequence of ignoring a weakness.

## Deadlift: Finishing Anyway

Even though I was out of the meet, I of course decided to deadlift. I told myself to shake it off and make the most of what I came here to do.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 1.5rem; align-items: flex-start; margin: 1rem 0;">
  <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 250px;">
    <p>Opener moved clean.</p>
    <p>Second attempt was 220 kg (485 lbs). Strong.</p>
    <p>For my third, I called for 502 lbs, 227.5 kg.</p>
    <p>It was slow off the floor. My grip felt tested. My finger was bleeding. But I kept pulling. Locked it out.</p>
    <p>That moment meant a lot to me. Not because of the number, but because I could have mentally shut down after bench.</p>
    <p>I did not, and I was able to hit all three of my deadlifts.</p>

# The Real Takeaways

### 1. Ego Is Expensive

My opener selection on bench was ego. Ignoring my technical flaw was ego. Believing I could “just fix it” on meet day was ego.

That cost me my total.

In lifting and in life, ego disguises itself as confidence. They are not the same thing.

This was a wakeup call for me, and honestly, I am now happy this happened. I know what I have to do in the future, and this exposed a flaw I have in many aspects of life.

---

### 2. Follow the Process Exactly

If you know something is wrong in training, it will not magically disappear under bright lights. This goes for everything.

From now on, every bench rep in training follows competition standards. Heels flat. Glutes planted. Pause commands respected. No exceptions.

Cutting corners compounds.

When practicing for speeches or events, I can't tell myself after every stutter it was just a one time thing, or I'll clean it up when there's an audience. When doing my homework, I won't look at the answers at the first sign of struggle. I will hold myself to a higher standard in everything I train for, and I believe while it will be harder it will help me grow.

---

### 3. Training Smarter Wins Long Term

RPE 6 to 8 felt too easy at first. But it built the base that allowed me to squat 405 and deadlift 502 even after bombing out.

There is a difference between intensity and recklessness.

I am learning that and trying my best to implement it now.

---

### 4. Do Not Compare to an Old Version of Yourself

I kept thinking about 198-pound me.

But that version of me had a different bodyweight, different leverage, different context.

The only comparison that matters is whether I am better than I was yesterday, because that is all I can really change. Everything else is purely detrimental mindset, and I will work on not getting hung up on things now out of my control.

---

### 5. Resilience Is a Choice

I cried. Then I walked back out and pulled over 500 pounds.

Life is going to hand out red lights sometimes. The question is whether you lay down or you keep lifting.

---

Overall, I am not happy with the outcome. I wish I had not bombed out. I wish I had trusted the process earlier.

But I am proud of how I responded.

This meet did not go how I planned.

The next one will.
