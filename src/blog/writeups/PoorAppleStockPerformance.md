# Why I Think Apple Stock Is Lagging in 2025

As of July 5, 2025, Apple stock is down **12.43%** year‑to‑date. That's way harsher than I expected, especially since the broader tech rally seems to have bypassed AAPL. Here’s my take, with some research, but still a bunch of my opinions.

## 1. Scale Means Slower Growth

Apple is a giant. With a valuation north of $3 trillion, hitting new highs gets way harder. You can’t keep cranking out growth when you’re already at that scale—it’s just math. Even analysts are pointing out iPhone demand has been flat & services growth is slowing.

## 2. AI Isn’t *That* Exciting

A big part of the concern is Apple’s AI momentum—or lack thereof. After WWDC, Apple’s AI hype didn’t translate into market confidence. The stock dropped ~1.5% during the keynote when they admitted Siri’s overhaul wasn’t ready ([Economic Times](https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/us/apple-stock-drops-1-5-after-wwdc-2025-keynotedid-apples-big-ai-reveal-and-siri-upgrade-fail-to-meet-investor-expectations/articleshow/121734860.cms)). Several outlets called their AI announcements underwhelming ([Tech Crunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/apples-upgraded-ai-models-underwhelm-on-performance/)).

## 3. Siri Is Still Siri

As someone who lives in the Apple ecosystem, the gap is glaring. I use a MacBook, iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, etc., but still, Siri can't do much beyond the basics. If I ask for a college baseball score, I shouldn’t just get links, I want the answer. A recent analysis rated Siri an "F" compared to ChatGPT's "A" ([Mac Daily](https://macdailynews.com/2025/06/27/gene-munsters-grades-openais-chatgpt-gets-an-a-apples-siri-gets-an-f/)). Siri will just give you web links for anything it kind immediately find, and that is frusturating. This should not be still happening at the point that we are at, now halfway through 2025.

## 4. Apple’s AI Models Still Behind

Apple’s new on‑device and server models haven’t closed the gap. Benchmarks show they barely match older GPT‑3.5 or standard Google/Alibaba models, not even the cutting-edge systems :contentReference([The Decoder](https://the-decoder.com/apples-new-ai-benchmarks-show-its-models-still-lag-behind-leaders-like-openai-and-google/)). Apple is pretty defensive when it comes to this kind of stuff, and you can really see it with their AI at the moment.

## 5. Acquisition or Partnership?

There are rumors Apple might try to accelerate by grabbing Perplexity AI or partnering with OpenAI/Anthropic ([IBD](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-possible-ai-deal-perplexity/)). But that option has trade-offs—loss of platform control, possible conflict with Google's search deal, and legal risks. Not to mention big acquisitions are rare for Apple (see Beats in 2014).

## 6. Analyst Views & Market Reaction

Wall Street is split—big tech peers (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta) have surged on AI momentum, whereas Apple lags ~12.5% down YTD. A MoffettNathanson analyst called Apple "rudderless in AI," citing iPhone headwinds, tariffs, and services lawsuits ([Barron's](https://www.barrons.com/articles/apple-stock-sell-tariffs-ai-china-sales-9ec890be)). On the flip side, some see it as a chance to “buy the dip” ([Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-investors-reconsider-buying-dip-013000759.html?)).

### My TL;DR Take

**So yeah, I think Apple stock is down because:**
1. It’s already too big for easy growth.
2. The AI storyline didn’t deliver. Siri is underwhelming and Apple’s models lag peers.
3. Investors were expecting more from WWDC and got a cautious roadmap instead.
4. The market is rewarding aggressive AI plays; Apple is playing it safe (which I still believe is fine).

## But I'm Still Bullish Long-Term

I love Apple products. UX matters more to me than bleeding-edge tech. If Apple adds AI features six months behind its rivals, but nails the polish and integration, I’m all in. I believe they’ll eventually win by rolling out AI that feels *Apple*—smooth, private, and reliable.

### What I’m Watching Next

- **Perplexity or OpenAI tie‑up** — Could give Apple the missing AI spark.  
- **Siri overhaul in 2026** — Will it meet expectations, or be another delay?  
- **Signs of top‑line bottoming** — If iPhone/services growth stabilizes, this dip could be a long‑term buying opportunity.

I’m not panicking, but I’m watching closely. Apple needs to show real, polished AI execution to turn sentiment back around. Until then, the stock might stay sloppy, but I'm trusting Tim Cook and maybe that’s just the price of patience in the Apple ecosystem.
