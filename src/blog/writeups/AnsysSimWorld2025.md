# What I Learned at Ansys Simulation World 2025

**Ansys Simulation World** is a global two-day event that brings together engineers, researchers, and technologists to explore the future of simulation and its role in solving some of the most complex challenges across industries. It features talks from top tech leaders, product demos, customer success stories, and deep dives into how simulation is being accelerated by AI and HPC.

I was only able to attend **Day 2** (July 17) of Ansys Simulation World 2025—Day 1 clashed with my internship—but I already had a fantastic experience. I’m planning to rewatch a bunch of the Day 1 recordings (especially Jensen Huang’s keynote on accelerated computing and Sandashiv Pimple’s talk on circuit breaker design) to round out what I learned.

## 🎥 What I’m Rewatching

- **Jensen Huang (NVIDIA)** on the journey of accelerated computing and a new industrial revolution—how AI is transforming the entire simulation stack and partnering with Ansys to reinvent engineering ([Ansys](https://www.ansys.com/blog/simulation-world-2025-learn-from-leaders?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
- **“Advancing Circuit Breaker Design”** by Sadashiv Pimple, Rockwell Automation—relevant to my industrial automation internship and really worth diving into.

## Pillars of Simulation: Where Ansys Is Headed

During the day, Ansys highlighted key industries being reshaped by simulation:

- Healthcare  
- High-tech & electronics  
- Industrial equipment  
- Automotive & transportation  
- Energy  
- Aerospace & defense ([Ansys](https://www.ansys.com/blog/simulation-world-2025-learn-from-leaders?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

These align with what I hope to impact in my career, and it was inspiring to see how simulation is central to their development.

## 🔥 Favorite Talk: The Power of AI to Transform Product‑Driven Industries

This session, led by **Simon Floyd** (Microsoft), was a highlight. It dove into:

- **Agentic AI & copilots** that speed design evaluation  
- **Digital twins** integrated with AI for discovery  
- **AI-driven robots & quantum potential**  
- **Microsoft AI Foundry**: agents that interact with simulation data  
- **Ansys + Microsoft via Azure** powering on-demand innovation ([Ansys](https://www.ansys.com/blog/simulation-world-2025-learn-from-leaders?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Ansys](https://www.ansys.com/blog/ansys-nvidia-gtc-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Ansys](https://www.ansys.com/events/sw-texas-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

It was a front-row seat to how AI is no longer an adjunct—it’s embedded in simulation workflows.

## High‑Fidelity Aerodynamics + GPUs

At 11 AM EDT, **Dr. Neil Ashton (NVIDIA)** presented “Enabling Rapid High‑Fidelity External Aerodynamics CFD Simulations with Ansys Fluent and NVIDIA Accelerated Computing.”  
He showcased:

- The push for high‑fidelity, GPU-accelerated CFD in automotive  
- Fluent benchmarks on Grace/Blackwell GPUs  
- Case studies with Volvo ([NVIDIA Newsroom](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-builds-worlds-first-industrial-ai-cloud-to-advance-european-manufacturing?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Ansys](https://www.ansys.com/blog/new-era-ansys-fluent-computations?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [SemiWiki](https://semiwiki.com/eda/ansys-inc/343263-unleash-the-power-nvidia-gpus-ansys-simulation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  

Seeing how simulation time drops dramatically with GPU support makes me think differently about what real‑time design iteration could look like.

## Why It Mattered

1. **Hands-on Q&A & Chat**  
   Ansys moderators actively answered my questions in real time. It made the virtual setup feel truly interactive.

2. **User focus**  
   Every session highlighted how Ansys consistently designs with engineer workflows in mind—whether that’s through better visuals, smoother solvers, or thoughtful integrations.

3. **AI + Simulation synergy**  
   The ties between agentic AI, digital twins, and GPU acceleration became crystal clear. It’s not marketing jargon; it’s a shift we’re living.

## 🔑 What I’m Taking With Me

- **Rewatch Day 1 recordings** to fill in gaps and catch more keynotes  
- Explore more on **AI copilots + simulation**—this is where future productivity lies  
- Look into **Ansys Fluent + NVIDIA GPU acceleration**, since HPC is only going to grow in relevance for control and electrical systems

## Thank You, Ansys!

Even though I missed the first day, Day 2 was full of insight, live interaction, and next‑gen ideas. Big thanks to Ansys for hosting such a polished experience and for making recordings available afterward—I'll make sure to catch up on everything I missed.
