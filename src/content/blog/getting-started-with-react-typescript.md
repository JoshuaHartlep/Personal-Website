# Getting Started with React and TypeScript

React and TypeScript are a powerful combination for building modern web applications. In this post, we'll explore how to set up a new project and some best practices.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, making it easier to catch errors early in development and providing better tooling support. When combined with React, it helps create more maintainable and scalable applications.

## Setting Up

1. Create a new project using Vite:
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd my-app
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure TypeScript:
   The basic configuration is already set up by Vite, but you can customize it in `tsconfig.json`.

## Best Practices

1. Use TypeScript interfaces for props:
   ```typescript
   interface ButtonProps {
     text: string;
     onClick: () => void;
     disabled?: boolean;
   }
   ```

2. Leverage type inference:
   ```typescript
   const [count, setCount] = useState<number>(0);
   ```

3. Use proper event typing:
   ```typescript
   const handleChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
     console.log(e.target.value);
   };
   ```
